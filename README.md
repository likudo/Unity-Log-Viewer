# Unity-Logs-Viewer


Please note that with the new Unity you can view device logs on the editor console window.  
Check the new attach menu in the editor console window.


Using this tool you can easily check your editor console logs inside the game itself!  
All what you have to do is to make a circle gesture using your mouse (click and drag)  
or your finger (touch and drag) on the mobile screen to show all these logs! 

~~You can download also from unity asset store~~  
~~https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/12047~~  

Assetstore version is outdated, does not support the new input system.
